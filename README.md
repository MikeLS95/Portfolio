# Purpose

The website was created for the purpose of displaying my personal and professsion history to potential employers and educators.

I created this website for my Term 1, Assignment 2 at Coder Academy.

# Functionality / Features

I have used a simplistic design utilising a retro colour scheme in an effort to not distract the reader from the content of the website.

On the top of each web page is a navigation bar.  The design of the navigation bar was to provide the reader with a clear and simple way of navigating to the different main pages of my website.

On the bottom of the history web page, there is a clickable link that will open my resume for print or download in a seperate tab.  I chose to make the resume open in a seperate tab to allow the reader to remain on the webpage without having to use offwebsite navigation to return.

The website includes the use of images: On the homepage to show readers an image of my appearance so when meeting me for the first time, they will have an idea of my appearance.  The footer displays two image icons pulled from ionic.io, these icons are for GitHub and Linked in, providing the reader a link to my social profiles.  Other images used in my portfolio website provide the reader a visual to accompany my blog entries linked to from blog-list.html.

My website also includes a contact me form.  The forms code was provided from formspree.com.  Formspree provides readers with a way to make direct contact with me.  The reader will enter their name and their email address along with the message they wish to send to me, once the reader has pressed the 'Send' button, I will reiceve an email that contains the name, email and message of the sender.

The final navigation option on my nav bar will take you to the webpage Blog.  On Blog there is a list of five separate blog posts with a title and a date.  Under the blog entry date, each entry has a clickable title link that takes the reader to a seperate page to display the blog post of that title and date.
