            <h2>Work History</h2>
            <H4>IT History</H4>
            <p>My history in IT environments includes my time working for The Department of Human Services, Centrelink
               and my time at Probe CX, where we were contracted to do work for the ATO.
            </p>
            <p>
              During my time working for both of these companies, I was a customer solutions officer, or in other words,
              inbound call operator.  Both Centelink and the contract work for the Australian Taxation Office involved me using thier internal information systems.
              Often having to search through their databases to get the information to assist the client on the other side of the phone.
            </p>
            <p>
              While I was at Centrelink I would also process claims for Senior Healthcare Cards.  
              My job required me to go through application forms and ensure everything was filled out correctly.  If they were Id process the claim into the system,
              and if they were not I would be required to contact the client for more information.
            </p>
            <p>
              While my current experience working in an IT environment is only call centre work, I intend to branch out and to evolve my knowldge
              and skills in IT environments.
            </p>
            <h4>Other Work History</h4>
            <p>Other than the work I have done with techology I have done a variety of jobs, some of which I was considering for a career before I ultimately decided I want to be in IT.
            </p>
            <p>
              Most of my early life in the workforce was working in hospitality.  I have done almost everything there is in hospitality, from washing dishes, to waiting tables, 
              to doing housekeeping work while I was in Canada.
              After hospitality I did some work in the Sunshine Coast, where I would drive up and down the coast cleaning the windows for business who would require my services.  This job taught me a lot of skills
              required for presenting myself to people as well as working efficently and effectively to make sure I could make it to every job on time and get the work done to a professional manner.
              I had to leave this job due to the pandemic hitting, and had to move back home to Toowoomba and start over.
            </p>
            <p>
              Another industry I have worked in is Aviation.  After cleaning windows on the Sunshine Coast, I enrolled in University to Study a bachelor of Aviation.
              I wanted to be able to learn first hand about aviation, and I started a job working as a ground handler for the local airport, Wellcamp Airport.
              While I was at welcome I had many of resposnbilities, such as marshalling in large aircrafts that had landed on the runway and needed to park on the apron.
              I would also be responsible for loading the baggage onto the plane and for the safe transport of passengers from the airport terminal to the aircraft.

            <h2>Educational History</h2>
            <H4>Highschool</H4>
            <p>I graduated highschool in 2012 after achieving both my Certificate II in business and my Certificate II in Information Technology.</p>
            <h4>University of the Sunshine Coast</h4>
            <p>Before I started cleaning store windows on the Sunshine Coast I enrolled into a Bachelor of Business at USC.  
               After completing my first semester at USC I decided I did not want to pursue a career in business.</p>
            <h4>University of Southern Queensland & Wings Flight Academy</h4>
            <p>I enrolled into the Bachelor of Aviation course at USQ after the pandamic forced me to uproot my life and move back to Toowoomba.
              I have always been interested in aircrafts and wanted to study to be a pilot.  When I saw that USQ offered a two year course followed by flight school I decided to enroll.
              I completed the two year course and was accepted into Wings Flight Academy intake for March 2023.
            </p>
            <p>
              While I was at Wings Flight Academy I was on my way to being a pilot.  I completed 3 hours total of solo flight time, as well as around 30 hours with an instructor.
              I passed my Private Pilots License written exam with a score of 84%, a mark I was very proud of.
            </p>
            <p>
              After completing the written exam it was time for me to start training for the practical flight test. During this time I decided that I did not want the lifestyle of a pilot and 
              decided to go into an industry I had more passion and gained more enjoyment out of, IT.
            </p>
            <h4>Coder Academy</h4>
            <p>I am currently enrolled in the Full Stack Web Development Coding Bootcamp, where I am learning new skills both professional and practical.
              While at Coder Academy I will how to be a professional in an IT enviroment as well as learning programing skills and languages to help me succeed in the industry.
