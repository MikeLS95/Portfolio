            <p>Hello, my name is Mike.</p>
            <p>I have created this website for my second assignment at Coder Academy.  
               The purpose of this website is to display my portfolio of work done within the Information Technology Industry.
               As this is my first project, I do not have much to display in the way of coding, however, I have include webpages to display some information about me.
               On the About Me webpage you can find information on my hobbies and interests, my travel experiences and my goals for the future.
               The history webpage will provide an overview of my most influential education and workplace experiences.  
               On this webpage you will also be able to find a link to my resume.
               On the final webpage, I have included a blog that currently includes five posts showing key moments in my life.
            <p>Underneath this section I have included a contact form, so if you wish to get in contact with me, 
               please provide your name and email address and send me a message and I will get back to you as soon as possible.</p>
