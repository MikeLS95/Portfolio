              <h3>Goals</h3>
                 <p>
                  I have just started at Coder Academy and am on my way to become a full stack web developer.  My partner and I have a child due in August and I plan on doing eveything I can
                  to provide a good life for our kid.
                 </p>
                  I intend on giving everything I have to this course and to becoming a great asset to any employer who is willing to give me a go.
                 </p>
                  As I currently have minimal education and experience in the world of IT, my primary goal is to better my skills and understanding in the area. I strive for constant improvment and reliablility.
                  I will be updating this website as I tone my skills within the industry and as my goalpost move to bigger and better things as I achieve the previous goals.
                 <p>
                  I am a strong believer of the quote "Every failure is a step closer to success".  I use these words to help myself stay focused and to evlove myself, not letting myself be held down by past mistakes.
                 </p>
              <h3>Hobbies and Interests</h3>
                 <h4>Gaming</h4> 
                 <p>I have been playing video games since I got my first console, the Nintendo 64 when I was five years old in the year 2000, I have been hooked ever since.
                 </p>
                 <h4>Guitar and Music</h4> 
                 <p>
                 When I was eight years old my mum bought be a guitar from a second hand store, and since then I have played on and off, these days mainly strumming to campfire style music.
                 </p>
                 <h4>Snowboarding</h4>
                 <p>
                 In Grade 12 I went on my school Ski trip.  I fell in love with the sport on this trip and have spent time doing snow seasons in both Canada and Australia.
                 </p>
                 <h4>Television</h4> 
                 <p>
                 Im drawn to shows that have stong character development, being able to watch a character grow and change as the show progresses.
                 </p>
              <h3>Travel</h3>
                 <p>
                 As I alluded to above, I have spent some time traveling, heading to both Canada and Victoria to snowboard.  I moved to Canada on a working permit in 2016 and left at the end of 2018.
                 While in Canada I spent 6 months in a ski village called Big White.  While on Big White I managed to accumilate 101 days riding on the mounting.  This was helped by having to ride my board
                 to get to work every day.
                 </p>
                 <p>After I left Big White, I moved to a surf town in Canada called Tofino.  
                 In Tofino I attempted to learn how to surf before I realised that waves are much more terrifying than snow covered mountains are.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                 I returned to Australia and quickly decided to head to Mt. Buller in Victoria in June 2018.  While on Mt. Buller I worked at a kiosk halfway down one of the longest ski runs on the mountain,
                 once again getting the opportunity to ride my board to and from work everyday.
